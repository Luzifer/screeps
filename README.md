This repository contains my game code for the [Screeps Game](https://screeps.com/), runnable in simulation mode and on the official MMO server(s).

It is a work-in-progress and might work for you if you really want to copy some other code instead of building your own logic. I suggest to work yourself through the tutorial and build your own logic from there.
